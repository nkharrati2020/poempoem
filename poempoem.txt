Once upon a time there was a pond
Where all the animals came out at night
And slowly soak up all the silver moonlight
The frog leaped into the mouth of the shark
The spider crawled across the ice cold surface
The fireflies lit up the twilight sky
The fishies drifted into the scary net
The lumberjack cut lilies with his axe
The ice cracked and the spider fell below
Shall I compare thee to a summers day
